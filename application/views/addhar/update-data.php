									Updating data on ADDhar </h1>

								<h2>Registered Mobile Number</h2>
								<p><b>Registered mobile number is essential to access ADDhar Online
										Services</b></p>
								<p>You can verify your mobile number that has been declared at the time of
									enrolment or during latest ADDhar detail update.</p>
								<ul>
									<li><a href=#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Verify Mobile Number</a>
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p>If you have not registered your Mobile number while enrolling for ADDhar,
									you are <b>required to visit a <a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Permanent Enrolment
											Centre</a></b> to get it registered.</p>
								<p>Enabling ADDhar for various services like Government &amp; Non-Government
									Services, Subsidy Benefits, Pensions, Scholarships, Social Benefits, Banking
									services, Insurance services, Taxation services, Education, Employment,
									Healthcare etc., makes it essential to ensure that ADDhar data of the
									resident stored in the CIDR is accurate and up-to-date.</p>
								<h2>Demographic data update, the need could arise from:</h2>
								<ul>
									<li><span class="li-text">Changes in life events such as marriage may lead
											to residents changing their basic demographic details such as name
											and address. Address and mobile number could also change due to
											migration to newer locations. Residents may also want changes in
											their relative’s details due to changes in life events such
											marriage, death of a relative etc. In addition, residents could have
											other personal reasons to change their mobile number, email address
											etc.</span></li>
									<li><span class="li-text">Changes in various service delivery platforms may
											lead residents to declaration request changes and to add mobile
											number to CIDR etc.</span></li>
									<li><span class="li-text">Errors made during the enrolment process wherein
											the resident’s demographic data may have been captured incorrectly.
											Changes to “DoB/Age” and “Gender” fields are expected primarily due
											to enrolment errors. </span></li>
									<li><span class="li-text">Since a resident can enrol anywhere in India, it
											may happen that a native speaker of language "A" is enrolled by an
											operator of language "B" and consequently the resident’s local
											language of enrolment is "B". Later, the resident may want to change
											the local language of enrolment to another that he/she prefers. If
											so, then all the demographic information that is printed on the
											ADDhar letter will need to be updated in the new local
											language.</span></li>
									<li><span class="li-text">UIDAI may also ascertain availability of POI, POA
											and other documents collected at the time of enrolment/update and
											its quality and decide to notify resident to update their
											demographic information and submit the required document.</span>
									</li>
								</ul>
								<h2>Biometric update, the need could arise from:</h2>
								<ul>
									<li><span class="li-text"> <strong>Age &lt;5 years at the time of initial
												enrolment -</strong>The child should be re-enroled when the
											child attains an age of 5 years and all biometric data should be
											provided. A de-duplication would be done for the child at this
											stage. This request will be treated similar to a new enrolment
											request while retaining the original ADDhar number</span></li>
									<li><span class="li-text"><strong>Age between 5 and 15 years at the time of
												enrolment -</strong> The resident should furnish all biometrics
											for updates when the resident attains age of 15 years.</span></li>
									<li><span class="li-text"> <strong>Age &gt;15 years at the time of enrolment
												–</strong> Residents are recommended to update their biometric
											data every 10 years.</span></li>
									<li><span class="li-text">Events like accidents or diseases leading to
											biometric exception</span></li>
									<li><span class="li-text">As the ADDhar authentication service is becoming
											ubiquitous, residents may also approach for biometric updates
											because of authentication failures (called false rejects – where a
											correct resident with valid ADDhar number may be incorrectly
											rejected) which may result from incorrect biometric capture or poor
											biometric quality captured at the time of enrolment. With
											improvements in technology, it may be possible to capture better
											quality biometrics in the CIDR.</span></li>
									<li><span class="li-text">UIDAI may verify the quality of biometric captured
											during enrolment/ update and decide a threshold. All the residents
											whose biometrics are below the decided threshold level may be
											notified by UIDAI to update of biometrics.</span></li>
								</ul>
								<h2>ADDhar details that can be updated are:</h2>
								<div class="table-responsive">
									<table class="horizontalTable content-table">
										<tbody>
											<tr class="horizontalTableRow">
												<td class="horizontalTableCol1">
													<p>Demographic information</p>

								<p>UIDAI update process accepts wide range of PoI (Proof of Identity) and PoA
									(Proof of Address) documents. View the <a href="https://uidai.gov.in/images/commdoc/valid_documents_list.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">list of supporting
										documents</a>.</p>
								<h2>Modes of Update</h2>
								<h3>1. Via Online</h3>
								<p>The Self-Service online mode offers address update to the residents where the
									resident can directly place the update request on the portal. The ADDhar
									number and registered mobile number of the resident are required to login to
									the <a href="https://resident.uidai.gov.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">portal</a>. The resident is authenticated
									using OTP on his/her registered mobile number. To complete the update
									process, resident needs to upload the <a href="https://uidai.gov.in/images/commdoc/valid_documents_list.pdf" target="_blank" class="img-responsive" rel="noopener noreferrer">supporting POA
										documents</a>, which will be
									verified against requested data at a later stage at UIDAI’s Update
									back-office by a Verifier. The resident needs to have mobile number
									registered with ADDhar for using this service.</p>
								</div>
								<h3>2. By Visiting Permanent Enrolment Centre</h3>
								<p>These are modes where residents place the demographic/biometric update
									request with the help of an operator at an <a href="https://appointments.uidai.gov.in/easearch.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Permanent Enrolment Centre</a>. In such a
									case, the documentary evidence is collected by the operator at the time of
									accepting the request. The document verification by the verifier also
									happens at the time of placing the Update request. UIDAI currently has
									envisaged three modes for Assisted Updates:</p>
								<h3>a. Update Client Standard</h3>
								<p><strong>Fields:</strong> All biometric and demographic fields as well as
									local language can be updated</p>
								<p><strong>Identity Authentication: </strong> Biometric check at the back-end.
								</p>
								<h3>Document Verification</h3>
								<ul>
									<li><span class="li-text">Verification done for those fields which require
											documentary evidence.</span></li>
									<li><span class="li-text">Verification done by verifier appointed by
											UIDAI/Registrars present at Enrolment / Update Centre. </span></li>
									<li><span class="li-text">The verification procedure followed should be in
											line with DDSVP Committee Recommendations followed during enrolment
											process</span></li>
								</ul>
								<h3>Form Filling and Acknowledgement</h3>
								<ul>
									<li><span class="li-text">Done by the operator on update client as requested
											by the resident. Handles spelling, language issues, transliteration,
											etc. Operator will provide biometric sign off against every update
											request. </span></li>
								</ul>
								<p>Resident gets an acknowledgement receipt with Update Request Number (URN)
									which can be tracked.</p>
								<div class="text-center"><img title="Biometric Update Process: Step 1 - Filling Application Form, Step 2 - Manual Verification of proof, Step 3 - Entry of Data into client software by operator, Step 4 - Biometric Authentication by Resident, Step 5 - Operator &amp; Supervisor's Confirmation, Step 6 - Acknowledgement of Receipt" src="../../images/update_client_standard.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Biometric Update Process: Step 1 - Filling Application Form, Step 2 - Manual Verification of proof, Step 3 - Entry of Data into client software by operator, Step 4 - Biometric Authentication by Resident, Step 5 - Operator &amp; Supervisor's Confirmation, Step 6 - Acknowledgement of Receipt" />
								</div>
								<h3>b. Update Client Lite (UCL)</h3>
								<p><b>Fields:</b> All demographic fields and Photo as well as local language can
									be updated.</p>
								<p><b>Identity Authentication: </b>Boimetric Authentication of resident.</p>
								<h3>Document Verification</h3>
								<ul>
									<li><span class="li-text">Verification done for those fields which require
											documentary evidence </span></li>
									<li><span class="li-text">Verification done by verifier appointed by
											UIDAI/Registrars present at Enrolment / Update Centre. </span></li>
									<li><span class="li-text">The verification procedure followed should be in
											line with DDSVP Committee Recommendations followed during enrolment
											process</span></li>
								</ul>
								<h3>Form Filling and Acknowledgement</h3>
								<ul>
									<li><span class="li-text">Done by the operator on update client as requested
											by the resident. Resident gets an acknowledgement receipt with
											Update Request Number (URN) which can be tracked. Operator will
											provide biometric sign off against every update request.</span></li>
								</ul>
								<h3>c. Update through AUA Point of Presence</h3>
								<p>This mode will be used by select Registrar who will also become AUA’s. UIDAI
									may provide application / APIs for Update. The Registrars selected for such
									updates will be Registrars known to collect/generate/possess and/or manage
									the particular demographic field and is a custodian of such data.</p>
								<p><b>Fields:</b> Demographic fields</p>
								<p><b>Identity Authentication:</b> Biometric Authentication of resident on the
									AUA device; UIDAI may decide to use other/additional authentication factors,
									if required. For example mobile OTP, for taking update requests from this
									mode.</p>
								<p>Operator will provide biometric sign off against every update request. Thus
									they must have ADDhar. Auth standards of UIDAI will be applicable for
									device/s used.</p>
								<p><b>Document Verification:</b> UIDAI will accept update based on Registrar’s
									verification process and Resident Authentication. For audit purposes,
									electronic/scanned document copies may be collected online. These document
									copies may be captured and received with each resident request, or may be
									made available, by the Registrar, in batches against the Update Request
									Numbers, Date and time.</p>
								<h3>Form Filling and Acknowledgement</h3>
								<ul>
									<li><span class="li-text">Done by Registrar’s Operator( employee/
											outsourced) on Device with Biometric Authentication Feature, such as
											a Micro-ATM Resident gets an acknowledgement receipt with Update
											Request Number (URN) which can be tracked. The acknowledgement may
											be print receipt and/or on SMS/email based on type of request. For
											example, for mobile number update, the acknowledgement can be a SMS
											on the given mobile number. The API will have the functionality to
											generate electronic as well Print receipts. The Registrar may
											provide print receipts at the end of taking update request, if they
											so decide. </span></li>
